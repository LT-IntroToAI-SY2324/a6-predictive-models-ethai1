# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value is 0.626 which means the linear regression model isn't very accurate and the data is spread out all over the place.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure for a 43 year-old person is around 137.46.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I don't think this model's predictions are very accurate due to the low r squared value but the data was close for the predicted value fo 43 years old so I would assume it's decently accurate. To improve the model, you need better data since it's very spread out which could suggest that age isn't very corrolated with blood pressure but I don't know much about this.
